ghostXML Plugin ToDo:

ToDo:
- If moved to a repo, move ToDo to the repo.

- If moved to a repo, delink anything from Fogbert CFBundleIdentifier.

- Keep an eye on unicode snafus.

- Look at using Beautiful Soup. Would it be better at iterating the entire XML file??

- Get self.debugLog into iterateXML module.

- Right now, there is only low(1) and high(3) debugging.

- Why not add a refresh when a new device is added so that it doesn't have to wait until
  the next comprehensive refresh?
  
- Move device refresh timing to the device config menu so that each device refreshes at
  its own rate?
  
- Right now, everything is a string. Could we implement evaluation logic
  (i.e.): float(), int(), bool() before creating states and adding data?

Known Issues:
- There are two instances of states that are defined in Devices.xml when called from
  Triggers and Control Pages.
