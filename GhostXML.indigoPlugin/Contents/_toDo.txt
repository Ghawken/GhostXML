ghostXML Plugin ToDo

ToDo:
- Change debug to new scalar.

- Keep an eye on unicode snafus.

- Add pushPluginPrefs() method like WUnderground.

- Look at using Beautiful Soup. Would it be better at iterating the entire XML file??

- Get self.debugLog into iterateXML module.

- Right now, there is only low and high debugging.

- Why not add a refresh when a new device is added so that it doesn't have to wait until
  the next comprehensive refresh?
  
- Move device refresh timing to the device config menu so that each device refreshes at
  its own rate.
  
- Right now, everything is a string. Could implement evaluation logic (i.e.):
	float(), int(), bool()

Known Issues:
- There are two instances of states that are defined in Devices.xml when called from
  Triggers and Control Pages.
