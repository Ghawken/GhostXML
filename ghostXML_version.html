Version: 0.3.01
EmailSubject: ghostXML Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The ghostXML Plugin you are using has been updated.

The changes:

Some JSON files contain an underscore character which caused problems when parsing the keys--this
version should eliminate the conflict. If your GhostXML implementation is working well, there is 
no need to apply this patch. 

v0.3.01
- Increases the plugin's ability to contend with certain characters that may be present in JSON keys.
