Version: 0.4.06
EmailSubject: GhostXML Indigo Plugin - Update Available
EmailBody: The GhostXML Plugin you are using has been updated.

This release combines all beta and other changes since the last stable release.

All users of the plugin can upgrade to this version (GhostXML now requires
Indigo 7.x). The GhostXML plugin now uses considerably fewer system resources
and all users running versions older than 0.4.04 are strongly encouraged to
upgrade their plugins.

Highlights:

v0.4.06
- Adds new Action Item to adjust the refresh frequency of a specified GhostXML device.
- Improves device configuration validation and help bubble text.

v0.4.05
- Adds feature to automatically disable a device if it has failed to refresh 10 times.

v0.4.04
- Adds option for sites that require token authentication.
- Completely refactors threading.
- Migrates plugin devices to their own class.
- Updates docstrings to Sphinx standard.
- Refines logging.
- Fixes bug where changes to debug level not applied.
- Fixes bug where curl reported error when completed successfully.

flatdict.py
- Adds trap for dict values that are empty lists or empty dicts. The trap replaces
the list or dict with 'None'. This allows the plugin to retain and show the key as
a device state.

v0.4.02
- Migrates writing of device states to API 2.0 [ dev.updateStatesOnServer() ].

v0.4.01
- Requires Indigo 7.0
- Updates to Indigo API 2.0
- Removes Toggle Debug from plugin menu.
- As always, if something doesn't seem quite right, please let me know.
